          <span>Ingredients<br></span>
          1 cup Unsalted Butter <br>
          1 cup White Sugar <br>
          1 cup Brown Sugar <br>
          2 Large Eggs <br>
          1.5 tsp Vanilla Extract <br>
          0.5 tsp Orange Extract <br>
          2 tsp Coffee <br>
          1 tsp Baking Soda <br>
          1.5 tsp Salt <br>
          3 cups Flour <br>
        </div>
        <div class = "page-instructions" id = "page-instructions">
          <span>Instructions<br></span>
          Preheat oven to 360 degrees. If you have convection, use it. Soften butter for 15 seconds in the microwave. In the bowl of a stand mixer,
          cream together the butter and both sugars until fully combined. Add the eggs, and mix until just incorporated. <br><br>Add the vanilla, orange,
          coffee, baking soda, and salt. Mix until fully combined. <br><br>Add flour in iterations of 1 cup. The dough should be slightly sticky when pressed.
          Take a spoonful and tilt it; the dough should stick to the spoon completely, not fall down. You may find that less that 3 cups of flour gives
          better dough, so add the last cup in smaller iterations. <br><br>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and scoop balls of dough of about 2.5 tbsp
          each, 6 cookies per batch. Bake for between 8 and 10 minutes, then let cool for at least 2 minutes on the baking sheet.
